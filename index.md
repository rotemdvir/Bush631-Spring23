## Course Description
This is a graduate course in quantitative social science research methods. We will learn how to construct research designs and use quantitative data to tackle a variety of questions in politics as a whole, and international affairs in particular. For example, What is the best way to predict election outcomes? What factors drive the onset of wars? What is the likelihood of a successful sanctions regime? In addition, some class sessions will offer an introduction to basic statistical skills to conduct research in the social sciences.  
The course integrates discussions about research design and data analysis with the focus on causal reasoning. It also emphasizes learning and practicing the skills to become proficient in the use of statistical software to manage and analyze data. Students submit tasks in which they design research relevant to their field of interest, practice programming, and prepare a final project that combines data analysis with policy relevance into a data-oriented infographic as well as a professional documentðŸ“ƒ.
